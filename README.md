# Open Selected Links
This is the source code for a Chrome extension to extract the `http` and `https` links from the user's selection on a web page, and open them all in a new window.  This is kicked off from a context menu item for the selection.

The extension is available on the Chrome Web Store as [Open Selected Links](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-selected-links/hcihcignkpajeehfnomlncinacagapdf).
