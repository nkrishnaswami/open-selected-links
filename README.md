# Open Selected Links
This is the source code for a Chrome extension to extract the `http` and `https` links from the user's selection on a web page, and open them all in a new window.  This is kicked off from a context menu item for the selection.

The extension is currently pending review for publication on the Chrome Web Store; I'll add a link if/when it is approved.
